## 1. Equipment

### 1.1 Computer

It is not obligated to have a personal computer for this course, you can always use the ones in lab *D-210*, which has all the apps that you need for all CST courses. However, it would be convenient to have a personal one. There is no preference on the OS, either Windows/MacOS/Linux is fine. However, since all machines in the labs have WindowsOS, it might be easier if you you Windows since the shortcuts will be the same. If you want to use Mac or Linux, that is alright too, some of the shortcuts might be different, but it is easy to figure them out.

If you want to buy a new computer, there are no specific requirements for it, whatever new machines you can find in stores would meet the minimum requirement. If you want to buy a laptop, I suggest you get one with an English keyboard, which will be the keyboard you may need to use in any company once you graduate. Also, arrow keys are frequently used while coding, so I would avoid any keyboard that has small arrow keys. Same as `Home`/`End`/`Delete`, if any of these keys are shared with other keys on a keyboard, I would try to avoid it.

### 1.2 Storage

Flash Drive is not necessary for this course, I encourage people to use a cloud server to store their files, so you do not need to worry about if your flash drive is damaged or lost. The college provides each of you with a free Office 365 account, you can log in to use the *One Drive* to store lectures, source code, etc.

## 2. Typing Speed

Whether you want to be a programmer or not, the chance that you will have to use a computer in your future is very high, thus typing with a decent speed is essential for you and will save you plenty of time.

An average typing speed of *40* is the minimum requirement for everyone, and if you can reach it, try to set your goal as *60*. Lower than that means you still need to sharpen your typing skills.

If you know touch typing (put your fingers at the right position on the keyboard, and do not need to look at the keyboard while typing), then you can use [https://monkeytype.com/](https://monkeytype.com/) for practice, 15 mins a day, or twice a day, you should see the difference in 2 weeks.

If you do not know touch typing, you can learn how to do it at [https://www.typingclub.com/](https://www.typingclub.com/). It might be slow at the very beginning, but you will be able to increase the speed soon. Again, practice makes perfect.

## 3. Use Keyboard

Many of you would like to use a mouse for most of your work, but it is not a good habit, and it slows you down. Try to use the keyboard for as many tasks as possible without using a mouse. That would require you to use a lot of shortcuts. Once you get familiar with it, you will like it and put your mouse away.

## 4. Ask Questions Properly

Many students and employees do not know how to ask a question properly, and that wastes a lot of time for both themselves and the person who try to help them. Try to ask the question specifically with useful information, and always first analyze the problem, so you can always provide some details when you ask a question, do not just say "It does not work".

## 5. Review Review Review

Many of you may feel a topic is simple and you understand everything, it might be true, but it is also true that you forget, sometimes it happens so quickly and you just need one night to forget what you have learned. Reviewing the topic on the same day is the key to success. Also, for someone who likes to take notes, taking notes does not guarantee you can absorb them, reviewing them on time is the most important step to transfer the notes from a notebook to your brain.

## 6. Keep Practice Until You Can Write It in 5 Mins

Many students asked me to provide more takes for them to practice. But the fact is that most of them are not even capable of solving the problems they have seen before. If it takes you more than 5 minutes to write a method, or even worse if you have to analyze, think, and finally write it with tries and errors, you should not just leave that task and switch to a new one. Instead, try to write that task again after a few minutes, and then see if you can write it smoothly. Only mark it as resolved if you can write it in 5 mins, before that, keep practice on it even though it sounds silly.

## 7. Schedule Everything

College is different than high school, no one will push you and force you to work on your work. You will have to motivate yourself, and usually, the ones who get success are not necessarily the smartest, but the ones with good habits. Trying to schedule your day/week and stick to it is one of the most important schedules that can lead you to success. If not, you will always have issues with deadlines, and deal with pressures when exams approach.

## 8. Markdown

I use markdown (`.md`) to write my lectures since it is light, easy to use, and it is free. You can open it with whatever text editor or even some apps on browsers.

You can find more details about it at [https://www.markdownguide.org/](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

A Cheat Sheet for markdown can be found at [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

Search keyword `markdown` on YouTube, you can also find tons of resources explaining how to use it.

Spend some time on it and know how to create the following items in markdown

* heading
* bold
* italic
* ordered list
* unordered list
* code
* fenced code block
